# Simulation---Transfer-matrix-for reflectance-calculation

The beetle Charidotella egregia is able to change its color reversibly when it is disturbed by external stressful events. The paper "Switchable reflector in the Panamanian tortoise beetle Charidotella egregia (Chrysomelidae: Cassidinae)". Vigneron, J. P., ... & Welch, V. (2007). Physical Review E, 76(3), 031907 has shown that the red color is due to the pigmentation of the beetle while the golden color is due to a stacking of thin layers. This color change can be seen through the reflectance spectrum of the multilayer structure of the beetle. The goal of this project is to obtain the reflectance spectrum of the article using the transfer matrix method on a stacked structure composed of three superposed Bragg mirrors.
